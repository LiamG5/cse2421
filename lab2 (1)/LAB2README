When doing part 3 my printfs keep showing up even though the expected ouput showed the 
bit_encode1 without the printf.
After looking into the makefile and reading about the-d PROMPT command
I belived that bit_encode2 is supposed to omit the printfs which is what happens.

keypattern = [?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?]
keypattern = [0,?,?,?,?,?,?,?]
keypattern = [0,?,?,?,0,?,?,?]

keypattern = [0,1,?,?,0,?,?,?]
keypattern = [0,1,?,?,0,1,?,?]

keypattern = [0,1,1,?,0,1,?,?]
keypattern = [0,1,1,?,0,1,1,?]

keypattern = [0,1,1,0,0,1,1,?]
keypattern = [0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]

6. didn't run on bit_encode1

the make file tool was nice as I didn't have to type out the sensitive and long commands
